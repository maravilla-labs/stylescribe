Page templates provide complete, ready-to-use layouts for common application screens.

## Overview

Pages combine components and blocks into full-screen layouts that serve as starting points for your application:

- **Dashboard** — Admin panels and data-heavy interfaces
- **Authentication** — Login, signup, and account recovery flows
- **Landing** — Marketing and promotional pages
- **Settings** — User preferences and configuration screens

## Structure

Each page template includes:

- Responsive layout that works across devices
- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Accessibility considerations built-in
- Placeholder content showing typical usage

## Usage

Copy a page template and customize it for your needs. Replace placeholder content with your actual data while keeping the underlying structure.
