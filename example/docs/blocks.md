Blocks are composite UI patterns that combine multiple components into ready-to-use sections.

## Overview

While components are individual building blocks, blocks represent common UI patterns you'll use repeatedly across your application:

- **Authentication forms** — Login, registration, password reset
- **Search interfaces** — Search bars with filters and suggestions
- **Navigation patterns** — Headers, sidebars, breadcrumbs
- **Content sections** — Hero sections, feature grids, testimonials

## When to Use Blocks

Use blocks when you need:

- A proven pattern that combines multiple components
- Consistent implementation across your application
- A starting point that you can customize

## Customization

Blocks use the same token system as components. Override block-specific tokens to customize appearance while maintaining the underlying structure.
